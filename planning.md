# FitFindr — planning.md

> Complete this document before writing any implementation code.
> Your spec and agent diagram are what you'll use to direct AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate your implementation — the more specific they are, the more useful the generated code will be.
> Your planning.md will be reviewed as part of your submission.
> Update it before starting any stretch features.

## Tools

List every tool your agent will use. For each tool, fill in all four fields.
You must have at least 3 tools. The three required tools are listed — add any additional tools below them.

### Tool 1: search_listings

**What it does:**
search_listings function runs load_listings function in tools.py which {Returns:
A list of listing dictionaries. Each listing has the following fields: - id (str) - title (str) - description (str) - category (str): one of tops, bottoms, outerwear, shoes, accessories - style_tags (list[str]) - size (str) - condition (str): excellent, good, or fair - price (float) - colors (list[str]) - brand (str or None) - platform (str): depop, thredUp, or poshmark
}
within search_listings function to
search listings.json for items matching description,size and max price. It returns a list of matching list dictionaries sorted
by best match first and returns empty array if nothing is found.

**Input parameters:**

- `description` (str): Keywords describing what the user is looking for
- `size` (str): Size string to filter by, or None to skip size filtering.
  Matching is case-insensitive (e.g., "M" matches "S/M").
- `max_price` (float): Maximum price (inclusive), or None to skip price filtering.

**What it returns:**
A list of matching listing dicts, sorted by relevance (best match first).
Returns an empty list if nothing matches — does NOT raise an exception.

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
If it returns nothing it should suggest a few options and stop.

### Tool 2: suggest_outfit

**What it does:**

<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

run_agent calls suggest_outfit which suggests 1-2 complete outfits based off of new_item and wardrobe parameters.it uses load_wardrobe_schema which when called returns {
A dictionary containing: - schema: the field definitions for a wardrobe item - example_wardrobe: a sample wardrobe with 10 items - empty_wardrobe: a starting template for a new user}

the suggest_outfit at the end of execution should return A non-empty string with outfit suggestions.If the wardrobe is empty, offer general styling advice for the item rather than raising an exception or returning an empty string.

**Input parameters:**

<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->

- `new_item` (dict): ...
- `wardrobe` (dict): ...

**What it returns:**

<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**

<!-- What should the agent do if the wardrobe is empty or no outfit can be suggested? -->

---

### Tool 3: create_fit_card

**What it does:**

<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**

<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->

- `outfit` (str): ...
- `new_item` (dict): ...

**What it returns:**

<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**

<!-- What should the agent do if the outfit data is incomplete? -->

---

### Additional Tools (if any)

<!-- Copy the block above for any tools beyond the required three -->

---

## Planning Loop

**How does your agent decide which tool to call next?**

<!-- Describe the logic your planning loop uses. What does it look at? What conditions change its behavior? How does it know when it's done? -->

---

## State Management

**How does information from one tool get passed to the next?**

<!-- Describe how your agent stores and accesses state within a session. What data is tracked? How is it passed between tool calls? -->

---

## Error Handling

For each tool, describe the specific failure mode you're handling and what the agent does in response.

| Tool            | Failure mode                          | Agent response |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| search_listings | No results match the query            |                |
| suggest_outfit  | Wardrobe is empty                     |                |
| create_fit_card | Outfit input is missing or incomplete |                |

## Architecture

<!-- Draw a diagram of your agent showing how the components connect:
     User input → Planning Loop → Tools (search_listings, suggest_outfit, create_fit_card)
                                                                          ↕
                                                                   State / Session
     Show what triggers each tool, how state flows between them, and where error paths branch off.
     Use ASCII art or a Mermaid diagram (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html).
     Do NOT embed an image — graders need to read your diagram directly in the file;
     an embedded image or screenshot cannot be evaluated.
     You'll share this diagram with an AI tool when asking it to implement
     the planning loop and each individual tool. -->

## AI Tool Plan

<!-- For each part of the implementation below, describe:
     - Which AI tool you plan to use (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
     - What you'll give it as input (which sections of this planning.md, your agent diagram)
     - What you expect it to produce
     - How you'll verify the output matches your spec before moving on

     "I'll use AI to help me code" is not a plan.
     "I'll give Claude my Tool 1 spec (inputs, return value, failure mode) and ask it to implement
     search_listings() using load_listings() from the data loader — then test it against 3 queries
     before trusting it" is a plan. -->

**Milestone 3 — Individual tool implementations:**

**Milestone 4 — Planning loop and state management:**

## A Complete Interaction (Step by Step)

Write out what a full user interaction looks like from start to finish — tool call by tool call. Use a specific example query.

**Example user query:** "I'm looking for a vintage graphic tee under $30. I mostly wear baggy jeans and chunky sneakers. What's out there and how would I style it?"

**Step 1:**

<!-- What does the agent do first? Which tool is called? With what input? -->

first the agent receive message/message history from ui input. Handle query is then called from ui, withing handle query run_agent
is called.

**Step 2:**

<!-- What happens next? What was returned from step 1? What tool is called now? -->

wardrobe is selected from wardrobe_choice and run_agent is called passing wardrobe_choice into the file agent.py run_agent function

**Step 3:**

<!-- Continue until the full interaction is complete -->

**Final output to user:**

<!-- What does the user actually see at the end? -->
